## Thanks

I could not have made this without a great deal of help from others. I am probly forgetting people, and all these developers have huge bodies of great open-source work to look at, so go checkout their Githubs.

- [@RobLoach](https://github.com/RobLoach)'s rad [pntr](https://github.com/robloach/pntr) and [pntr_app](https://github.com/robloach/pntr_app) make up most of the game-engine, and also he's been extremely helpful with ideas & design.
- [@twuky](https://github.com/twuky) has been very helpful with ideas & design.
- [@dcodeIO](https://github.com/dcodeIO) for helping with types in assemblyscript, and wasm in general.
- [WAMR](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime) is used as the native wasm-host
- [mattiasgustavsson's libs](https://github.com/mattiasgustavsson/libs) are a nice & light collection of headers, that include assetsys (which I used at one point, for filesystem.)
- [c-vector](https://github.com/eteran/c-vector/) is a nice well-made & light variable-length array that I use for assets and stuff
- [sfx_gen](https://github.com/WickedSmoke/sfx_gen) is a nice & light way to generate sound-effects
- [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) is so nice. Easy & fun to work with, fast, efficient, and has a ton of features, and Ray & the community around Raylib are incredibly helpful. I am not using it in the current engine, directly, but they have been super-helpful with showing me stuff and just being generally mega-nice people.
- [TIC80](https://tic80.com/) & [wasm4](https://wasm4.org/) and [lutro](https://www.libretro.com/index.php/lutro-easy-retro-game-creation-powered-by-libretro/) and [love2d](https://love2d.org/) are a constant source of inspiration. No code is used directly from these, but they really helped me figure out what I was trying to do.
